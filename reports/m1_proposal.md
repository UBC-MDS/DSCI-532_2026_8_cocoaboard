# Project Proposal for Chocolate Sales Dashboard

## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

### Target Audience

Our target audience will be primarity Sales Managers, Regional Sales Directors or C-suites at a chocolate manufacturing/distribution company. Our team will serve as Data Analytics Consultants for the sales team providing actionable insights to help the leadership team optimize their sales strategy and resource allocation.

### Problem

Here are the challengs facing by the chocolate company:

- Inconsistent sales performance across regions and salespeople 
- Inefficient product mix decisions 
- Reactive rather than proactive management - Monthly or quarterly reviews happen too late to course-correct, and they need real-time visibility into trends
- Missed opportunities - They can't easily identify seasonal patterns, top customers, or which salesperson-product combinations work best

### Solution

Creating machine learning models often involves writing redundant code, particularly when tuning hyperparameters and comparing performance across different models. This project aims to reduce that redundancy by streamlining these repetitive steps, making the model development process more efficient and time-effective. To achieve this, our project focuses on building reusable functions that, given user input, automatically return the optimal hyperparameters, the best-performing model, its accuracy score, and a corresponding confusion matrix, all in a single, unified workflow.
