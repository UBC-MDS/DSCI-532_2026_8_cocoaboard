| 1   | When I am reviewing monthly or quarterly sales reports, I want to see total sales and breakdowns by country and product, so I can align targets and resource allocation with actual performance. | ✅ Implemented |Filters (date range, country, product) + KPI value boxes are live |
| 2   | When I am planning product mix and promotions, I want to see which products sell best over time and by country, so I can prioritize premium lines and seasonal campaigns.| 🔄 Revised | Originally included YoY % change in value boxes; deferred to M3 due to complexity. Revenue Over Time chart added instead |
| 3   | When I am evaluating my sales team, I want to compare salespeople by revenue and boxes shipped by region, so I can recognize top performers and support those in underperforming areas. | ⏳ Pending M3  | Salesperson leaderboard table planned for M3 |
